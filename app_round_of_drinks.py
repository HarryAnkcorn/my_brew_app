# ideas:
# for ordering it should show thier perfences with the oppostion to make the round the same as thier everybody preferences
# fix "your usual of None"
# error when not selecting a drink, out of range index
# click ENTER to select the preference drink or skip
# export a fancy list
# code deletes all the rows then writes all new rows
# ids keep increasing
# if a drink is a spirit then it goes with a mixer
# put in try and expects
